# Classifying Iris Dataset Using SVM
This project used three types of support vector machine (SVM) to make predictions on the Iris dataset :
1. Linear SVM
2. RBF kernel SVM
3. Polynomial kernel SVM

Furthermore, the results demonstrate the relationship between the success rate and the parameters by adjusting the model parameters.
